# Scientific Computing 01 #


This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on a weekly basis.

Keep yourself updated on changes in the [CURRICULUM](https://github.com/CHCAA-EDUX/scientific-computing-01/blob/main/CURRICULUM.md)

---

In this workshop, you will get introduced to programming principles, project management, cloud computing, and version control.

The course will be based on the programming language `Python`. No prior knowledge about `Python` is required.

We have in total 6 x 2 hours together, so it is gonna be some compact and informative lessons.
We will be around 3-4 instructors each time to help you get through the workshop in the best manner.

The course is taught by [Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus](https://chcaa.io/#/), any inquiries can be addressed to:

* Ida Marie Lassen: idamarie@cas.au.dk
* Kenneth Enevoldsen: kenneth.enevoldsen@cas.au.dk
* Lasse Hansen: lasse.hansen@clin.au.dk

## Technicalities
We will help you set up all requirements in the first class.
Bring your own laptop.

You should all have a WAYF login in order to sign in to Ucloud.


## How to find help?
If you have a problem this is the steps we recommend

0) Isolate the problem, what is going wrong and where?
1) Reexamine the reading, often it contains relevant information.
2) Check if the course  [issues](https://github.com/CHCAA-EDUX/scientific-computing-01/issues) or [StackOverflow]((https://stackoverflow.com) have an answer to your problem. 

If you still can't solve the problem:

3) Produce a minimal example of the problem, i.e. somethings which allow others to reproduce the error.

If the problems is general:

4) Ask in on an online help forum e.g. StackOverflow, or Cognitive Science [CogOverflow](https://www.facebook.com/groups/340151913001608/)

If the question if course specific:

4) Create an [issue](https://github.com/CHCAA-EDUX/scientific-computing-01/issues) on the GitHub
